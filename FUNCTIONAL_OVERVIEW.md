* Imbalanced contribution to household chores.
* Miscommunication regarding shared supplies and house rules.

## ✨ Key Functionalities

### 1. 💰 Smart Expense Management (Financial Harmony)
* **Bill Tracking:** Easily log shared expenses (rent, utilities, groceries) and upload receipts for transparency.
* **Fair Splitting:** Automatically calculate debt divisions based on custom rules (e.g., equal split, by room size, or individual consumption).
* **"Who Owes Who":** A real-time dashboard showing net balances, simplifying the repayment process by minimizing the number of transactions needed between roommates.

### 2. 🧹 Automated Chore Scheduler (Fair Play)
* **Rotation Logic:** Automatically generates a fair, rotating roster for recurring tasks (e.g., cleaning the kitchen, taking out the trash).
* **Reminders:** Notifies roommates when their assigned turn is approaching.
* **Accountability:** Users can mark tasks as "Completed," providing visibility to the whole house.

### 3. 🛒 Shared Pantry & Inventory (Smart Living)
* **Collaborative Shopping List:** A synchronized list where any roommate can add needed items (e.g., "Milk," "Detergent") in real-time.
* **Inventory Tracking:** Prevents over-buying or running out of essentials by tracking what is currently in stock.

### 4. 📢 The House Board (Communication)
* **Centralized Notices:** A digital bulletin board for posting important house announcements (e.g., *"Landlord visiting on Tuesday"*, *"Party on Friday"*).
* **House Rules:** A permanent, accessible reference for agreed-upon house guidelines (quiet hours, guest policies).
